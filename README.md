In this project, a K-NN model was implemented to classify the quality of wines from their chemical
properties. I will perform some analyses on a provided dataset and use these to answer conceptual
questions. I will then have a choice of various ways to extend and evaluate the basic K-NN model.

The data for this assignment is a modified sub-
set of the “Wine Quality” dataset from the UCI Ma-
chine Learning Repository. The original dataset
can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/
dataset/186/wine+quality.
